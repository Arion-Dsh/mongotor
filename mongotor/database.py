        Send command `command` to the database and return the
        response. If `command` is an instance of :class:`basestring`
        then the command {`command`: `value`} will be sent. Otherwise,
        `command` must be an instance of :class:`dict` and will be
        sent as is.

        Any additional keyword arguments will be added to the final
        command document before it is sent.

        For example, a command like ``{buildinfo: 1}`` can be sent
        using:

        >>> db.command("buildinfo")

        For a command where the value matters, like ``{collstats:
        collection_name}`` we can do:

        >>> db.command("collstats", collection_name)

        For commands that take additional arguments we can use
        kwargs. So ``{filemd5: object_id, root: file_root}`` becomes:

        >>> db.command("filemd5", object_id, root=file_root)

        :Parameters:
          - `command`: document representing the command to be issued,
            or the name of the command (for simple commands only).

            .. note:: the order of keys in the `command` document is
               significant (the "verb" must come first), so commands
               which require multiple keys (e.g. `findandmodify`)
               should use an instance of :class:`~bson.son.SON` or
               a string and kwargs instead of a Python `dict`.

          - `value` (optional): value to use for the command verb when
            `command` is passed as a string
          - `**kwargs` (optional): additional keyword arguments will
            be added to the command document before it is sent

        .. mongodoc:: commands
        """
